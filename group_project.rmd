# Introduction
<!-- %TODO Briefly give meaning to your project â€“ what is the background and why is this project important?  (20 points) -->
This project examines NCAA Division I athletics. We used the data from the Equity in Athletics Survey, Year 2017-2018, from the U.S. Department of Education Office of Postsecondary Education [-@EADA2018].

# Hypotheses

## Head Coaches of Men's Teams and School Type
<!-- %TODO Clearly state the hypotheses being tested. (20 points) -->
<!-- Note: we need the two spaces at the end of the first line of the hypothesis test-->
\(H_0\):  
\(H_1\):

## Head Coaches of Men's Teams and Participation
<!-- %TODO Clearly state the hypotheses being tested. (20 points) -->
\(H_0\):  
\(H_1\):

## ANOVA 
\(H_0\):  
\(H_1\):

Calculate a new variable Profits from Revenue - Expenses. Do expenses per male and expenses per female have main effects on revenue?

# Methods
<!-- %TODO State and explain the methodology used to test the hypotheses.  (20 points) -->

# Results
<!-- %TODO Describe the data (1st paragraph) -->

## Describing and Visualizing Head Coach data
```{r hist of head coach, message=FALSE}
hd.coach.salary_data <- ncaa.div.i_data %>%
  select(sector_name, HDCOACH_SALARY_MEN)

hd.coach.salary_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = HDCOACH_SALARY_MEN, fill = sector_name)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title="Histogram of NCAA Div. I Men's Head Coach Salary", x = "Salary (USD)",
       y = "Count", fill = "School Type:") +
  theme(
    legend.position="bottom",
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'white', color = 'grey'),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.25, linetype = 'solid',
                                color = "grey"), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.1, linetype = 'solid',
                                color = "grey")
  )
```

## Describing and Visualizing Participation of Men and Head Coach Salaries
```{r scatter plot of head coach salaries}
men.participation.data <- ncaa.div.i_data %>%
  select(IL_PARTIC_MEN, HDCOACH_SALARY_MEN)

men.participation.data %>% ggplot(aes(x=IL_PARTIC_MEN, y=HDCOACH_SALARY_MEN)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  labs(title="Scatterplot of Men's Head Coach Salary by Men Particiation Counts", x = "Count of Men Participating",
       y = "Head Coach's Salary (USD)") +
