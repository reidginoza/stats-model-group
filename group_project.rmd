# Introduction
<!-- %TODO Briefly give meaning to your project â€“ what is the background and why is this project important?  (20 points) -->
This project examines NCAA Division I athletics. We used the data from the Equity in Athletics Survey, Year 2017-2018, from the U.S. Department of Education Office of Postsecondary Education [-@EADA2018].

# Hypotheses

## Divisions and Profits


## Head Coaches of Men's Teams and School Type
<!-- %TODO Clearly state the hypotheses being tested. (20 points) -->
<!-- Note: we need the two spaces at the end of the first line of the hypothesis test-->
\(H_0\):  
\(H_1\):

## Head Coaches of Men's Teams and Participation
<!-- %TODO Clearly state the hypotheses being tested. (20 points) -->
\(H_0\):  
\(H_1\):

## Difference in Classifications
There are 18 different classifications, including NCAA Division I-FCS, NCAA II without Football, and so forth. This question looks at the means of the profits for each classification.
\(H_0\): \(\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \dots = \mu_{18}\)  
\(H_1\): At least one is different

## Difference in Classfications (Nonparametric)

# Methods
<!-- %TODO State and explain the methodology used to test the hypotheses.  (20 points) -->

# Results
<!-- %TODO Describe the data (1st paragraph) -->

## Results of Difference in Classification
```{r ANOVA for sectors}
classification.results <- aov(Grand.Total.Profits ~ classification_name, data = institution_data)
almost_sas(classification.results)
```

```{r Classification Kruskal-Wallis}
classification_kruskal.results <- kruskal.test(Grand.Total.Profits ~ classification_name, data = institution_data)
classification_post.hoc <- kruskalmc(Grand.Total.Profits ~ classification_name, data = institution_data)

# pander(classification_post.hoc[[3]], style='rmarkdown')  # TODO: shorten table!
```

## Describing and Visualizing Head Coach data
```{r hist of head coach, message=FALSE}

## Describing and Visualizing Participation of Men and Head Coach Salaries
