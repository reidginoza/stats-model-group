# Introduction
<!-- %TODO Briefly give meaning to your project â€“ what is the background and why is this project important?  (20 points) -->

This project examines potential(?) salary differences between head coaches from public and private NCAA Division I institutions. We used the data from the Equity in Athletics Survey, Year 2017-2018, from the U.S. Department of Education Office of Postsecondary Education [-@EADA2018].

# Hypotheses

## Divisions and Profits

## Head Coaches of Men's Teams and School Type
<!-- %TODO Clearly state the hypotheses being tested. (20 points) -->
<!-- Note: we need the two spaces at the end of the first line of the hypothesis test-->
\(H_0\):  
\(H_1\):



```{r}
wilcoxon1<- institution_data %>%
  select(classification_name, HDCOACH_SALARY_MEN, HDCOACH_SALARY_WOMEN) %>%
  gather("Gender", "Salary", -classification_name)
wilcoxon1$Gender %<>% recode(HDCOACH_SALARY_MEN="Men", HDCOACH_SALARY_WOMEN="Women")
wilcoxon1_results <- wilcox.test(Salary ~ Gender, alternative = 'two.sided', data = wilcoxon1, paired = FALSE)
wilcoxon1_results
gender_wilcoxon_p.value <- wilcoxon1_results$p.value %>% p.value.string
```
**Hypotheses**<br>
\(H_0\):  \(M_{male} = M_{female}\)<br>
\(H_1\): \(M_{male} \ne M_{female}\)

**Test Statistics**<br>
$W=`r wilcoxon1_results$statistic`$$

**$p$-value$$**<br>
$`r gender_wilcoxon_p.value`$

**Rejection Region**<br>
Reject $H_0$ if $p<\alpha$, where $\alpha = 0.05$.

**Conclusion**<br>
Reject $H_0$. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the the mean salaries of male headcoach and female headcoach are different.

### fit model
```{r}
### try to fit a model between "Count of Men Participating" and "Head Coach's Salary"
shapiro.test(log(participation.data$IL_PARTIC_MEN))
shapiro.test(log(participation.data$HDCOACH_SALARY_MEN)) 
### the results indicates that the datas don't follow normal distribution.
model1=glm(log(HDCOACH_SALARY_MEN) ~ log(IL_PARTIC_MEN),data=participation.data)
summary(model1)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(model1)
